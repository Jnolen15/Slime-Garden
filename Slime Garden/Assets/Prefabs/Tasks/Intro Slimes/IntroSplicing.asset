  - The miracle of life!

    from each parent slime. Use it to get all kinds of combinations!
  - Over time baby slimes will age and eventually grow into mature full sized slimes.
  - "Baby slimes don\u2019t produce as much Crystalized Slime as adults. But they
    make up for it in adorableness!"
