  dialogue:
  - When you feed a slime its hunger meter will fill up. Different foods will fill
    different amounts.
  - A full slime is a happy slime! Hunger can affect the growth of baby slimes and
    the value of CS in mature slimes.
  - "However, slimes don\u2019t need food to survive as they get energy from the
    sun. But who doesn't love a good snack?"
