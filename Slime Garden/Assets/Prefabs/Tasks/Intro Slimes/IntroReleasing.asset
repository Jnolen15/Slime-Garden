  dialogue:
  - A released slime will be returned safe and sound back to the wild.
  - Slime love living here in your habitat, but if you wish to release them back
    to the wild, they will understand.
  - Slimes will even leave you a parting gift of Crystalized Slime as they go! How
    generous.
  - Note that released baby slimes will not give nearly as much CS, as they have
    not had as much time to develop yet.
