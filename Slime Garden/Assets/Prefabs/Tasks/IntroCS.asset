  - As you have seen, slimes naturally produce a byproduct.
  - "Over time some of a slime\u2019s slime will become hardened and form a chunk
    of crystallized slime which they will then expel."
  - This crystalized slime is quite valuable, and even used as a currency around
    here. So if you see any in your habitat, be sure to pick it up!
