  - The habitat is looking better already!
  - You can also press [R] while building to rotate the item before placing.
  - If you place something in the wrong spot, or change your mind, you can get rid
    of it with the destroy tool and will even be refunded some of its cost.
  - You just unlocked some gardening supplies! Place down a few of those farming
    tiles first so you have somewhere to plant a few Snackroot.
  - Once you have placed a few down, you can plant Snackroot with the planting tool
    by clicking on the dirt mounds.
