  dialogue:
  - Great job taming that wild slime!
  - As your farm level increases, more slime species will appear in the wild. So
    be sure to return from time to time.
  - You just unlocked the slime artifact! A powerful ancient slime device that allows
    for the creation of new slimes.
  - Once you have built the artifact, drag a slime onto each of the two input pedestals
    on the left and right sides of the device.
  - Once you have done that, the button between them should light up. It will require
    some CS to activate, but if you have enough press it!
